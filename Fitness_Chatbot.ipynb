        "* Receive input data (e.g., a set of actions or conditions).\n",
        "* Learn from these inputs (using basic reinforcement learning techniques, for example).\n",

        "### **Project Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Agentic Fitness Chatbot is an intelligent assistant designed to help users achieve their fitness goals by providing personalized workout and meal recommendations. The bot adapts in real-time based on user feedback, continuously improving its suggestions by learning from the user's preferences and behavior. This project implements Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to provide real-time adaptation to the chatbot's recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Features**\n",
        "* User Profile Creation: Users can input their personal details (age, weight, height) to personalize the chatbot's recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Fitness Goal Selection: Users can specify their fitness goal (weight loss, muscle gain, endurance) to receive tailored workout and meal suggestions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Real-Time Adaptation: The chatbot learns from the feedback provided by the user (e.g., ratings for workouts and meals) and improves its future suggestions using Q-learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Progress Tracking: Users' workout feedback (ratings and like/dislike) helps the bot to adjust future recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Technologies Used**\n",
        "* Python: Main programming language for developing the chatbot and implementing Q-learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Pandas and Numpy: For managing data and mathematical operations.\n",
